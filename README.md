Shapefiles and Geojsons of India according to Indians - For use in research and other academic or personal projects by Indians.

##Background

I have been doing a lot of research and data analytic work, both personal and professional, which have required a geographic representation. However, I have found it very difficult to get Shapefiles or GeoJSONs representing India in the legally correct representation. I even approached a few government agencies requesting them for the officially recognised border maps. However, I couldn't find any that met my requirement. 

I finally managed to customise some shapefiles to create the correct borders of India. I am not very sure about the legal status of the shapefiles. However, I will be giving full attribution to all the sources I have used to create my version.

I also intend to use this page to document how I modified the shapefiles so that others facing similar issues in their neighbourhood can use it.
